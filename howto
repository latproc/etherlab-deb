A short explanation of how to generate a new etherlab debian package. This
assumes that your debian tools are setup (e.g. ~/.devscripts, debuild and
the stuff needed by etherlab)

1. Clone Etherlab and DebianPackage repository.
2. Symlink the folder  DebianPackage/etherlab-deb/debian into Etherlab/debian
3. cd into Etherlab repository.
4. call dch -i. If all was right, the changelog should come up with a new
   entry. Change the version on top to date+revision-1 of the branch tip.
5. run 'debuild -b -us -uc', then test the package installation with 
   'sudo debi etherlab-devel_DATE+REV-1_amd64.changes'.
